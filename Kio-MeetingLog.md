- 15/2: Created my github repo, MeetingLogFile, added my kanban board and a init commit. Added my HTML, CSS, JS file.
- 16/2: Added a TypeScript file, added npm express.
- 17/2: Created a Server.js file for my local server and routing configuration for my Single Page Application. Added som Subpages into my views map to load my pages
through one index.html. Finished the routing part.
- 22/2: Created my own API. Created my own user.json file to fetch some contact info to my Contact tab. Trying to host my server live. I have some problem with hosting my contact info live. I can not upload my contactinfo.
- 23/2: Focused mostly on fetch an extern web API and a little on responsiveness. I choose to fetch a weather API.
- 24/2: Finished my web API. Unfortunatly I could not load it through the same html document so I had to creat an API folder that includes the API.Html and API.JS file for fetching my weather API. I also added an okta login account which I commented out. The backend part works fine but I have problems with the frontend.
- 25/2: Focus on responsivness and fillin my dev page and home tab's content.
