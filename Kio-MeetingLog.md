- 22/2: Created my own API. Created my own user.json file to fetch some contact info to my Contact tab. Trying to host my server live. I have some problem with hosting my contact info live. I can not upload my contactinfo.
- 23/2: Focused mostly on fetch an extern web API and a little on responsiveness. I choose to fetch a weather API.
- 24/2: Finished my web API. Unfortunatly I could not load it through the same html document so I had to creat an API folder that includes the API.Html and API.JS file for fetching my weather API. I also added an okta login account which I commented out. The backend part works fine but I have problems with the frontend.
